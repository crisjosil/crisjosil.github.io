In this post we will explore a flooding mapping application from freely available remote sensing imagery, particularly using the Sentinel-1 satellite, which provides Synthetic Aperture Radar data. 

Part of the ideas described in this post are based on this [tutorial] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=derOXkPCH80) and this [post](https://labo.obs-mip.fr/multitemp/mapping-flooded-areas-using-sentinel-1-in-google-earth-engine/). In this case, however, we will do it directly from QGIS using the python EE plug-in (link) which allows us to combine all the advantages of the google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to retrieve the already pre-processed satellite images with a very powerful and open source geospatial analysis software. We can then easily add to our project other shapefiles, raster and ground truth (csv files) data as well as exploit all the data analysis tools provided by python packages, i.e. numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, etc.

We will also see how with minimal modifications to our code we can readily analyse very different test sites and will see as examples the floods registered in Vietnam in 2015 using the same example as in [here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=derOXkPCH80) but without the pre-processing and in the river Severn, near Shrewsbury in England, at the beginning of this year (2020).

You can find the code for this post here (link)

Here is a quick look of the results obtained following the steps mentioned below

Getting ready
======
Before we begin, we need to ensure that we have installed both the QGIS plug-in as explained [here] (https://gee-community.github.io/qgis-earthengine-plugin/) and the Google Earth Engine python API. We also need to provide our credentials to GEE so that we can access the satellite data with our account details. For more info about this have a look at this previous [post] (https://crisjosil.github.io/posts/2020/02/blog-post-1/).
Now we need to open the python console in QGIS by clicking in “plugins, python console”. After that, the console appears, and we need to click on the “show editor” button where we will be adding the required python code.

```python
import ee
from ee_plugin import Map
