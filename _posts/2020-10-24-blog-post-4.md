In this post we will explore a flooding mapping application from freely available remote sensing imagery, particularly using the Sentinel-1 satellite, which provides Synthetic Aperture Radar data. 

Part of the ideas described in this post are based on this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=derOXkPCH80) and this [post](https://labo.obs-mip.fr/multitemp/mapping-flooded-areas-using-sentinel-1-in-google-earth-engine/). In this case, however, we will do it directly from QGIS using the python EE plug-in (link) which allows us to combine all the advantages of the google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to retrieve the already pre-processed satellite images with a very powerful and open source geospatial analysis software. We can then easily add to our project other shapefiles, raster and ground truth (csv files) data as well as exploit all the data analysis tools provided by python packages, i.e. numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, etc.

We will also see how with minimal modifications to our code we can readily analyse very different test sites and will see as examples the floods registered in Vietnam in 2015 using the same example as in [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=derOXkPCH80) but without the pre-processing and in the river Severn, near Shrewsbury in England, at the beginning of this year (2020).

You can find the code for this post here (link)

Here is a quick look of the results obtained following the steps mentioned below

Getting ready
======
Before we begin, we need to ensure that we have installed both the QGIS plug-in as explained [here](https://gee-community.github.io/qgis-earthengine-plugin/) and the Google Earth Engine python API. We also need to provide our credentials to GEE so that we can access the satellite data with our account details. For more info about this have a look at this previous [post](https://crisjosil.github.io/posts/2020/02/blog-post-1/).
Now we need to open the python console in QGIS by clicking in “plugins, python console”. After that, the console appears, and we need to click on the “show editor” button where we will be adding the required python code.

Imports
======
```python
import ee
from ee_plugin import Map
import time
from datetime import datetime
```

Preliminary functions
======
First of all we will define a couple of useful functions that will be used later in our code. We start with a function to obtain the Sentinel-1 images from GEE based on parameters such as the dates and area of interest, the desired radar backscatter polarisation (VH, VV or VH and VV), and the acquisition geometry (ascending or descending pass and orbit number). The python code with the corresponding code looks like this:

```python
def get_Sentinel1_img(Latitude,Longitude,date1, date2,Direction,orbit_No):
    sentinel1 = (ee.ImageCollection('COPERNICUS/S1_GRD')
            .filterDate(date1, date2)
            .filter(ee.Filter.listContains('transmitterReceiverPolarisation', 'VV'))
            #.filter(ee.Filter.listContains('transmitterReceiverPolarisation', 'VH'))
            .filter(ee.Filter.eq('instrumentMode', 'IW'))
            .filter(ee.Filter.eq('orbitProperties_pass', Direction))
            .filter(ee.Filter.eq('relativeOrbitNumber_start', orbit_No))); 
              
    sentinel1 = sentinel1.filterBounds(ee.Geometry.Point(float(Longitude),float(Latitude)))
    
    recent = sentinel1.sort('system:time_start', False)
    lista = recent.toList(20)
    sentinel1_info=lista.getInfo()
    Images_in_collection=[]
    for i in range(len(sentinel1_info)):
        Images_in_collection.append(sentinel1_info[i]['id'])
    img_ID=Images_in_collection[0]
    img_ = ee.Image(Images_in_collection[0])
    return(img_,img_ID)
```
  
Now we will define a function that allows us to extract the date of the retrieved image from the title. The name conventions for a Sentinel-1 image are explained [here](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-1-sar/naming-conventions ):  

```python
def get_img_date(a):
    b=a.split(sep='_')
    b1=b[5].split(sep='T')
    b2=b1[0]
    return(datetime.strptime(b2, "%Y%m%d"))
```
  
We are going to now indicate the range of dates where the flooding occurred, the location and the acquisition geometry. As we can see in the code below, the python list dates_pre_flood contains a range of 10 days from where GEE will select the available image prior to the flooding, while dates_post_flood is the range of dates from where to select the image posterior to it. With the map_center list, we are indicating the location of our test site (Latitude, Longitude), while Direction and orbit_No define the acquisition geometry to be used.
```python
##############################
######### England ############
##############################
dates_pre_flood =['2020-02-10','2020-02-24']  
dates_post_flood=['2020-02-24','2020-03-15']
map_center=[52.669613,-2.632745] 
Direction = "DESCENDING"
orbit_No  = 154# 
```
We then define few other auxiliary variables:
```python
names=['Pre flooding image','Post flooding image']
Latitude  = map_center[0]
Longitude = map_center[1]
Map.setCenter(Longitude,Latitude, 13)
```
Now we are ready to fetch the Sentinel-1 images from GEE filtering by the previously defined conditions, repeating for the pre-flooding event dates and the post-flooding event dates.
```python
# Pre flood
date1 = ee.Date(dates_pre_flood[0])
date2 = ee.Date(dates_pre_flood[1])
img_pre_flood,img_ID = get_Sentinel1_img(Latitude,Longitude,date1,date2,Direction,orbit_No)
VV_pre=img_pre_flood.select('VV') # 
date_pre_flood=get_img_date(img_ID)

# Post flood
date1 = ee.Date(dates_post_flood[0])
date2 = ee.Date(dates_post_flood[1])
img_post_flood,img_ID = get_Sentinel1_img(Latitude,Longitude,date1,date2,Direction,orbit_No)
VV_post=img_post_flood.select('VV') # 
date_post_flood= get_img_date(img_ID)
```
