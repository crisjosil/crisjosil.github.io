I'm Cristian, a PhD researcher at the university of Stirling, Scotland. I’m interested in extracting information from freely available aerial images supported by statistical and machine learning algorithms. The specific and current focus of my PhD research is on the use of multi-temporal and polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for agricultural fields monitoring. I try to understand crop and SAR signal interaction, extract fields insights and to develop near-real time crop monitoring and early warning systems. This information is a key input to contribute to food security and the promotion of efficient and sustainable agriculture.I’ve worked with farmers, crop types and test sites in multiple countries including Peru, Colombia Spain, and Canada. 

Previously, I worked as electrical engineer in Colombia, my home country, designing control and protection systems in the oil and gas industry. Before the PhD, I studied an MSc at Swansea university in Wales, a postgrad specialization course in project management and my BSc in Colombia. Have a look at my resume for more information. 

In my free time you can find me running, hiking, socialising or learning a new coding trick.

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
