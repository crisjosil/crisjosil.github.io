I'm Cristian, a PhD researcher at the university of Stirling, Scotland. I’m interested in extracting information from freely available aerial images supported by statistical and machine learning algorithms. The specific and current focus of my PhD research is on the use of multi-temporal and polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for agricultural fields monitoring. I try to understand crop and SAR signal interaction, extract fields insights and to develop near-real time crop monitoring and early warning systems. This information is a key input to contribute to food security and the promotion of efficient and sustainable agriculture. I’ve worked with farmers, crop types and test sites in multiple countries including Peru, Colombia Spain, and Canada. 

Previously, I worked as electrical engineer in Colombia, my home country, designing control and protection systems in the oil and gas industry. Before the PhD, I studied an MSc at Swansea university in Wales, a postgrad specialization course in project management and my BSc in Colombia. Have a look at my CV for more information.
